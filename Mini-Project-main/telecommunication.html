  <h1 id="head">Telecommunication Technologies</h1><br>
  
  <div class="basic">
    <p>Telecommunications are the means of electronic transmission of information over distances. The information may be in
    the
    form of voice telephone calls, data, text, images, or video. Today, telecommunications are used to organize more or
    less
    remote computer systems into telecommunications networks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The transmission media in telecommunication have evolved through numerous stages of technology, from beacons and other
    visual signals (such as smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs), to electrical cable
    and electromagnetic radiation, including light. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels,
    which afford the advantages of multiplexing multiple concurrent communication sessions. Telecommunication is often used
    in its plural form, because it involves many different technologies.</p>
  </div>
  
   <div class="natural">
      <h2>1. Natural effects</h2>
      <p>Telecommunications infrastructure — mobile phone towers and heavy overhead cables — have spread rapidly across densely
      populated urban areas since 1994. Under exemptions granted to carriers, State, Territory and local governments have
      limited powers to curb the activities of carriers anxious to grab market share at the expense of the environment.
      Consumers have voiced their concerns about the cost implications of unnecessary infrastructure duplication. Residents
      have raised concerns about the health implications of electromagnetic radiation and the visual impacts of aerial cabling
      and mobile telephone towers. The Committee is concerned that appropriate environment and planning regulations are liable
      to be traded off by the Government in pursuit of a higher sale price for Telstra.</p>

  <div class="technical">
      <h2>2. Technical advantages</h2>
      <p>The telecom sector is made up of companies that aid in the transfer of information possible on a global scale, whether
      it is through the internet, phone, cables, airwaves, wire or wirelessly. The infrastructure created by these companies
      allows data transfer through voice, words, audio or video, anywhere in the world. Satellite manufacturers, telephone
      operators, internet carrier providers and cable companies provide seamless support towards the development of the
      telecom sector.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In developed countries, the telecom sector becomes the backbone for enhancing human life quality. This industry has
      changed beyond its recognition in the past 10 years, with clients’ wishes and competitive landscapes moving in
      approaches that few could have expected. Post 1995 countries have witnessed a surge in mobile telephone penetration.
      India was a late starter but eventually has emerged as the fourth largest promising market in the telecom sector in
      Asia, after China, Japan and South Korea. In fact, India has emerged as the eighth largest in the world and second
      amongst the growing economies.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We can consider that the telecom industry is the center for digital growth and will continue to play the role of a
      disruptor. In our social and work fabric, terms like mobile, cloud, analytics broadband etc. have become a common lingo.
      Video streaming, digital payments etc. etc. have become an obvious choice.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thus, the future of the telecom sector will have to deal with additional advancements posited by new technologies. Some
      digital applications of the future generation technologies are cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial
      Intelligence (AI), 3-D Printing etc., where devices shall communicate with each other. Big data and analytics are also
      there and thus proper policies must be at place to handle security and privacy issues. IoT and other associated
      technologies are likely to compound these problems.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through a qualitative based research study on select TSPs, authors have crafted a list of TSPs across the world, which
      is around 79 in numbers. All these TSPs were examined on the basis of their journey that included their total revenue,
      usage of the future generation technologies etc.</p>

    <h2>4 Telecommunications Trends to Watch in 2020</h2> <br>
    <p>This year, telecommunications companies are gearing up for some of the biggest technological advancements the industry
    has seen in years. Trends such as the 5G revolution and the advancement of the internet of things (IoT) will reshape the
    telecom sector and force innovation on a massive scale. This post explores four of the most pertinent advancements that
    will affect telecom companies in 2020.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>5G Networks</h3> <br>
    <p>5G stands for 5th generation — the most recent iteration of broadband connection. 5G brings three major upgrades to the
    table. It provides greater speed to move more data, decreases latency for shorter load times, and increases the ability
    to connect more devices at once.
    <br>
    5G networks will enable more detailed and efficient augmented and virtual realities, higher resolution video, fully
    autonomous vehicles, massive connected IoT networks (like smart cities), and more.
    <br>
    5G is the most highly anticipated change to the future of telecom. Though it isn’t set to officially launch until 2021,
    the four major U.S. cell carriers have already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127801/5g-news-progress-features-verizon-att-tmobile-sprint">announced</a> they’ll be releasing 5G capabilities in 2019, some as early as
    May.</p> <br>
    <h3>IoT and Smart Cities</h3> <br>
    <p>The IoT consists of a network of connected devices, able to communicate with each other, and which can be controlled and
    monitored remotely. By 2021, there will be an estimated 30 billion connected IoT devices worldwide, many of which will
    be industrial connections, an essential component of smart cities.
    <br>
    Smart cities take the IoT a step further by creating an interconnected network that residents can access online, often
    via a mobile app. A network like this will provide data and communication channels that allow users to better manage
    their day-to-day activities, from corresponding directly with their government, to instantly finding a parking spot on a
    busy day.<br>
    
    The main goal of smart cities is to create a better quality of living for their citizens by streamlining urban services
    like energy and transportation through smart technology. However, prior to the promise of 5G networks, experts couldn’t
    foresee the capacity to support the amount of data a truly connected city would generate. Now that 5G is on the horizon,
    major urban areas will be racing to be the first to introduce their own smart city.</p> <br>
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3> <br>
    <p>AI in the telecom industry encompasses a myriad of focus areas. Customer service and network optimization are at the top
    of that list. Throughout this year, some of the biggest implementations of AI will be in these spaces (this seems
    redundant). In fact, according to IDC <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/why-telcos-will-soon-be-betting-on-artificial-intelligence-to-build-their-networks/61531211">63 percent of telecom companies are investing in AI systems this year.</a>
    <br>
    Predictive analytics is one of the most promising capabilities of AI technology, especially for the telecom community.
    AI-based analytics provide telecom companies with the ability to use data and machine learning software to predict
    future industry trends and potential infrastructure snags, and to continuously assess their service for bugs or
    potential pitfalls.<br>
    
    Additionally, AI-based chat-bots and virtual assistants will transform the way businesses handle customer service. They
    can automate conversations and successfully mimic human speech, while drawing data and insights to provide personalized
    and positive experiences. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChR0aiBWLrvPj7bD830ttUQ">Tech leader Mark Hurd</a> believes that 85 percent of interactions with customers will be
    automated by 2020.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Diversified Ecosystems</h3> <br>
    <p>Much like ecosystems function in nature, industrial ecosystems are a network of cross-industry organizations that work
    together to create a stronger, more advanced industry. The telecom industry will see a move toward creating those
    lucrative ecosystems. <br>
     
    According to a recent Accenture report, ecosystems will unlock $100 trillion in value during the next 10 years by
    unlocking competitive agility. Telecom companies have the highest potential to come together and form such alliances.
    Industry leaders agree, with 83 percent citing ecosystems as an important piece of their disruption strategy.
    <br>
    The introduction of IoT networks, backed with 5G capabilities, will make this even easier and will allow companies to
    seamlessly collaborate to advance these technologies across their networks.
    <br>
    The telecommunications industry is a vital center for cutting-edge technology adoption. With the integration of AI
    technologies, 5G networks, and the IoT, telecom organizations will continue to be at the forefront of technological
    growth.</p> <br>
